"""
This module offers utilities for CSV file operations within the NFL predictor project, focusing on
efficiently reading, writing, and updating CSV files in conjunction with pandas DataFrames. It aims
to simplify data import/export, ensuring effective data management.

Key Functions:
- read_write_data: Manages reading from or generating data for a CSV file, then writing it back,
  useful for datasets needing regular updates.
- read_df_from_csv: Reads data from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, with an option to check
  file existence.
- write_df_to_csv: Writes a pandas DataFrame to a CSV file, including directory creation and index
  preservation.

Dependencies:
- os: For file and directory checks.
- pandas (pd): For CSV operations and DataFrame manipulation.
- constants: Accesses project-wide constants like data storage paths.
- logger (log): For logging messages and errors, aiding in debugging and monitoring.

Usage:
Essential for stages requiring data ingestion from or persistence to CSV files, supporting tasks
like loading historical data, storing processed data, and exporting data for external use. It
enhances data management efficiency and reliability by abstracting CSV handling complexities and
leveraging pandas DataFrames.

) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Reads data from a CSV file or generates it using a specified function, then writes it back.

    This function checks if a CSV file with the given data name exists. If it does and
    force_refresh is False, it reads the data from the file. Otherwise, it generates the data by
    calling the provided function and writes the new data to a CSV file.

    Args:
        data_name (str): The base name of the data file (without extension).
        func (Callable): The function to generate data if needed.
        *args: Positional arguments to pass to the data generation function.
        force_refresh (bool, optional): If True, forces data regeneration. Defaults to False.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass to the data generation function.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The data as a pandas DataFrame.
